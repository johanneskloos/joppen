# prettyprint: An Oppen-style pretty-printer for Java.

This library provies an implementation of Oppen's pretty-printing algorithm, as first
described in Derek C. Oppen, "Prettyprinting", TOPLAS Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct. 1980, pp. 465-483.

It is also inspired by the various implementations of the algorithm for functional programming
languages, such as OCaml's Format module and various others.
